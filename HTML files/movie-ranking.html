<hr />

<h3>1.Guardians of the Galaxy.</h3>
<p>This was an eye catching science-fiction movie. Further i loved it's next parts too.</p>

<h3>2.Dhammal</h3>
<p>All time favourite comedy movie.<br /> I have watched it more than 5 times & still counting.</p>

<h3>3.Bahubali: The beginning & Bahubali: The conclusion</h3>
<p>It was an action thriller movie with eye catching graphics.<br /> I waited for years to know why Kattapa killed Bahubali even when both loved each other.</p>

<h3>4.Drishyam</h3>
<p>It was a complete thriller movie.It showed how much influence movies <br />put on a person that a 4th standard failed adult killed a young boy & still <br />deceived the police officers very cleverly, all he learnt was from watching <br />movie as he was a fond of watching movie.</p>
